            Hello, my name is Coltin Rogge, I am 21 years old, this is my second year at 
            Lewis but I am technically a senior because I transferred here from Morraine Valley. 
            <br>I live with my mom and my brother, and my parents are divorced so I don't live with my dad. 
            I have a pet dog named Mugsey and a pet tortoise named Leo. <br>I am majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Video Game Development.
